# Project-OneFile

A collection of **single-file HTML programs**.  
Each program is **one `.html` file** that you can open directly in a browser.

## How to Run
1. Open this repo
2. Click any `.html` file
3. Download it (or clone the repo)
4. Open the file in your browser (double-click)

✅ Works offline by default (unless the file uses online assets).

## Project Rules
- **One file = one program**
- HTML only (CSS goes in `<style>`, JS goes in `<script>`)
- Should run by just opening the file

## Programs(edit later)
- `index.html` — (example) Home page / menu — **Status:** WIP
- `clock.html` — (example) Digital clock — **Status:** Stable
- `game.html` — (example) Mini game — **Status:** Buggy (see Known Issues)

## Known Issues / Bugs
Some programs are experiments and may have bugs.  
If you find one, please open an Issue with:
- file name (`game.html`)
- what you expected vs what happened
- browser + OS
- screenshot if possible

### Current Known Issues
- `game.html`: (example) Sometimes score doesn’t reset after restart.
- `clock.html`: (example) Layout breaks on very small screens.

## Improvements Wanted
Ideas for future upgrades (PRs welcome):
- Add an `index.html` that links to all programs
- Make layouts mobile-friendly(some are already mobile-friendly)
- Add simple instructions at the top of each file
- Reduce duplicated code between files (while staying single-file)

## Browser Support
- Only tried Chrome
- Other browsers should work
